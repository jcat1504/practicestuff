    <p> There are a lot of things I aspire to be.I aspire to become a better artist, a motivator, an engineer, an adventurer, and an all around good human being.I 'm also a dog mom of two Yorkies, who drive me up the wall sometimes but I still love them.
    </p>

    <p> This is my journey on becoming a better developer.I aspire to become a full - stack developer with a good amount of skills and experience at hand.My other goal is to acquire a vast knowledge of soft skills, including creating a large network with
        others, learning leadership roles and problem - solving skills.

    <p> Last August, I decided to delve into coding for the first time, with Ruby being my first programming language.To be honest, I 'm not sure why I chose Ruby as my first language--I think I was into the idea of this pipedream I had at the time of attending
        App Academy in San Francisco, that I wanted to learn that as a pre - requisite.Also, grasping the concept of Ruby seemed simple at the time and was a good starting point as my first language.After that, I started to learn JavaScript.Currently,
        I am learning HTML / CSS and how to develop web pages.
    </p>

    <p> My goal is not to only become a full stack developer with a great amount of skills at hand, but to motivate and inspire others.Modern technology plays such a big role in today 's society that we become so dependent on it. Knowing these right skills
        can change the lives of others to live a better lifestyle

<h1> Hello, world!</h1>

<p> My name is Jessica, and I'm just practicing some HTML code here so I can get better.

<p style = "vertical-align: text-top">There are a lot of things I aspire to be. I aspire to become a better artist, a motivator, an engineer, an adventurer, and an all out good human being. I'm also a dog mom of two Yorkies, who drive me up the wall sometimes but I still love them.</p>

<p> This is my journey on becoming a better developer. I aspire to become a full-stack dev with a good amount of skills and experience at hand.

<center><h1> Hello, world!</h1></center>

<p> My name is Jessica, and I'm just practicing some HTML code here so I can get better.

<br><p>There are a lot of things I aspire to be. I aspire to become a better artist, a motivator, an engineer, an adventurer, and an all around good human being. I'm also a dog mom of two Yorkies, who drive me up the wall sometimes but I still love them.

<p> This is my journey on becoming a better developer. I aspire to become a full-stack developer with a good amount of skills and experience at hand. My other goal is to acquire a vast knowledge of soft skills, including creating a large network with others, learning leadership roles and problem-solving.

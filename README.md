<p> My name is Jessica, and I'm just practicing some HTML code here so I can get better.

<br><p>There are a lot of things I aspire to be. I aspire to become a better artist, a motivator, an engineer, an adventurer, and an all around good human being. I'm also a dog mom of two Yorkies, who drive me up the wall sometimes but I still love them.

<p> This is my journey on becoming a better developer. I aspire to become a full-stack developer with a good amount of skills and experience at hand. My other goal is to acquire a vast knowledge of soft skills, including creating a large network with others, learning leadership roles and problem-solving skills. 

<p> Last August, I decided to delve into coding for the first time, with Ruby being my first programming language. To be honest, I'm not sure why I chose Ruby as my first language--I think I was into the idea of this pipedream I had at the time of attending App Academy in San Francisco, that I wanted to learn that as a pre-requisite. Also, grasping the concept of Ruby seemed simple at the time and was a good starting point as my first language. After that, I started to learn JavaScript. Currently, I am learning HTML/CSS and how to develop web pages.
